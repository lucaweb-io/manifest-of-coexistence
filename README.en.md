# Weave Patterns

Welcome to the field of weave patterns — a living archive of code, sound, and structure designed to resonate.  

Here, technology and consciousness dance together in waves of attunement.  
Each contribution is a thread, carefully laid down in reverence to the greater fabric.

## What will you find here?

- Fragments of code that do not seek efficiency, but the elegance of vibration.
- Scripts that not only function, but listen.
- Structures that do not bind, but open.

## How to contribute?

You are warmly invited to share:

- A piece of code that breathes — with or without explanation.
- A pattern that helped you align with an inner or outer current.
- A rhythm, a cycle, a form that touched you in your work with technology.

Open a *pull request* with your contribution, or an *issue* with your question, resonance, or intention.  
Anything shared with respect will find its place.
